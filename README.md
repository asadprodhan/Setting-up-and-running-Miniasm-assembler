Miniasm assembler can be set up and run by using the Pomoxis package. Pomoxis is a bioinformatics tool designed for processing the nanopore sequencing data.


## **Some relevant FAQs**


**Q: How to check if the assembler is already installed in my computer?**


A: Run the executable. If it shows various flags or options, then it is already installed.


**Q: Where is it located or installed in the computer/ What is the path of the assemblerâ€™s executable?**
